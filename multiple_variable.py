fruit = ["banana","apple","oranges"]
x, y, z = fruit 
print(x)
print(z)
print(y)






# Step 1: Create a list called 'fruit' with exactly three items
# This list acts like a container holding three values in a specific order
#fruit = ["banana", "apple", "oranges"]

# Step 2: Unpack the list into three variables: x, y, and z
# Python matches each variable to one item in the list based on position:
# x gets fruit[0] → "banana"
# y gets fruit[1] → "apple"
# z gets fruit[2] → "oranges"
#x, y, z = fruit

# Step 3: Print the value of x
# This will show "banana" because x was assigned the first item in the list
#print(x)  # Output: banana

# Step 4: Print the value of z
# This will show "oranges" because z was assigned the third item in the list
#print(z)  # Output: oranges

# Step 5: Print the value of y
# This will show "apple" because y was assigned the second item in the list
#print(y)  # Output: apple
